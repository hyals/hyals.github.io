# CHAPTER 02
# I carry you with me, always

【August 15th, 649 in the Calendar of Creation.】

In the dimly lit room, the air thick with nostalgia and the faint scent of ravanki flower buds, sat nothing but one figure. The young boy, Hya, shrouded in a veil of solitude, nestled by the window’s edge of the most sacred location in all of Heaventia—the «Anima Castle», the great fortified structure built by one of the gods of creation, located in the capital city Cordia.

Indifferent to the views of the land he was one of the heirs of, his gaze instead set on a crimson red quartz, the only companion within those walls. It was the embodiment of his late mother’s soul he'd been engaged in one-sided conversations with for an uninterrupted span of two hours—a «soul fragment».

It is not rare for one to speak with soul fragments. Even without receiving a response, this tradition offers solace, reaffirming the bond between the soul and the holder and uniting them beyond the confines of mere physical recognition.

Although soul fragments can take various shapes, they are typically quite small. As a result, many people choose to keep their loved ones close, often in the form of rings, pendants, earrings, or bracelets. This practice is a way to honor and remember the life that once was. For him, this is embodied by a pendant he carries with him.

All he knew was that his mother, Aemilia, had tragically passed away 16 years ago during the mass-murder incident known as the «Second Impact». It occurred on the very day that he, Hya, and his twin brother, Lina, were born.

Hya couldn’t help but envy those who could enjoy their loved ones in-life. Still, transcending the lack of shared moments, he cherished her through the last object left behind—after all, even in a colorless world, love is the one thing that transcends death.

“Good night, mother.”

At the rise of the morning sun, a sudden shock rips him from the depths of slumber. A suffocating heaviness clung to his neck, constricting his very breath with clear killing intent. But no matter how much he struggled, his body was completely unresponsive.

—G-gghh-...!

His eyes quickly scanned the room in desperation, only to find no one. He was certainly alone in that room. But that couldn’t possibly be true. After all, in this exact moment, the unmistakable sensation of being strangled was irrefutable.

In what seemed like his final moments, Hya had a hazy recollection of last night’s dream. It was a scenery painted in blue. Letting himself go into the canvas, his existence felt increasingly muted and colorless.

Is this truly for the best…?

The question he pondered in his fading breaths sparked a small, humble flame, but the next thought quickly snuffed it out.

I really can’t bear to endure any more sadness, any more grief.

If that is how things are going to be, perhaps it’s better to stop right here. And yet, it was as if the world itself ruthlessly demanded him to go on,  for his twin brother entered the room as the first tendrils of light crept through the window.

Lina and Hya were both 16 years old, identical in many ways as expected of twins. Their features mirrored each other almost perfectly, yet a striking difference between them had set them on diverged paths from the moment they had been born. Lina's hair was a deep black, while Hya's was a colorless white. But their distinction ran deeper than merely the color of their hair. In Heaventia, where everyone was distinguished by their blue eyes, Lina’s gaze was no exception. Hya, however, possessed striking red eyes.

This wasn’t a trivial difference—it was a division that couldn’t be ignored. Lina was, without question, an angel. Hya, on the other hand, carried within him the unmistakable traits of a demon. And in a world where one’s race dictated their role, this contrast would determine more than just how he was seen. It has shaped his past, present and will unmistakably continue to shape his future.

Nevertheless, Lina disregarded the division and stood firm against the world's prejudice.

“Hya! Hya! What’s wrong?!” Lina's voice pierced the heavy silence.

Yet, Hya, consumed by despair, offered no reply. His gaze, haunted and distant, seemed like an endless void.

And so, Lina dared to draw closer. His touch was gentle upon Hya's trembling form, dissipating the crushing sensation.

"I am here, dear brother," Lina murmured, and as tears overflowed from his eyes, he held Hya in a tight embrace, as if afraid he might slip away.

Then, he warmly reached out for Hya’s hand, drawing it closer to his chest. “There is no need for you to dwell on anything besides this sensation.” he said, now locked eye-to-eye.

The meaning behind those words was something Hya knew well.

Over time, angels developed a practice effective in regulating their emotions. That act bears the name of «pulsus moderatio» and involves checking the pulse, as they softly press the index and middle fingers to the side of their neck. Soon enough, this practice was deeply rooted in Heaventian culture and took various forms: such as «pulsus implicantes», people interlacing and checking on each other's pulse.

And so, Hya focused on his twins’ pulse. His very own slowly began to match the pace, and, subsequently, his heavy breathing stopped. It was as if, in that moment, they mixed into gray and became one.

"A-alive... We're alive," Hya said.

Lina smiled softly, his eyes shining with warmth. “And for as long as we are alive, we will bear each other’s burdens,” Lina said, his voice gentle yet firm. “Didn’t you say so yourself? Back when we were children…”

A bittersweet smile formed in Hya's lips, recalling the countless times he had uttered those words to comfort Lina during their childhood.

"We were always together, back then," Lina continued. "Say, brother, don't you think we can go back to those times? To the innocence of being children, when the world was just us?"

Hya let out a sigh; the weight of what had happened rested heavily on him. The innocence of childhood felt lost, buried beneath layers of regret. Life was so simple then, he wished he had never found the world's heartlessness and just lived, blind, in ignorant bliss.

"I…-" Hya whispered, his voice barely loud enough to carry to his twin's ears. It wasn't that he didn't want to return to those days; it was that he couldn't. He felt he couldn't. Not yet. Not when it was this painful for him even to look at his brother.

Hya had long forgiven himself for being born. He hadn’t chosen to be born with white hair or those crimson eyes. But there was one thing he could never forgive himself for. Lina's body was covered in countless scars. It was a painful reminder that Lina would, without a doubt, die long before he would. This was the one truth Hya could never escape—the consequence of breaking the rules of the world.

It didn’t matter that Hya and Lina saw each other as equals—the world refused to see it that way. Hya knew he would inevitably bring tragedy to those close to him. Like on that one day. That’s why he had long withdrawn from the world, once more, just as it had demanded, becoming a slave of its rules. It did not matter to him if that way he could protect those he loved.

But today, all of that may change. Today, an opportunity to change his fate will take place. Hya had decided to fight back against the world. 

Please wait for me a little longer, brother.

The future was uncertain, fraught with challenges they could not yet foresee. But in this moment, holding his brother close, all seemed to fade away. For a brief, precious moment, they were just two siblings, intertwined, finding tranquility in each other. And so, Hya let himself forget a little.

Taking refuge from the sun, a boy and a girl sat under the shade of a grand old tree located in the main garden of Anima Castle. The air was thick with the scent of summer and the soft rustling of leaves, creating a peaceful backdrop to their conversation.

“So, how did you like it?” the girl, Vita, asked with a proud glint in her eyes, as if she already knew the answer. “My cooking is the best thing there is in all of Cordia, isn’t it!”

The boy, Gaukel, looked up at her with wide-eyed amazement, his mouth still full of food. “Waaah! Vita, I’ve never tasted, let alone seen anything like this before…!” he exclaimed eagerly, struggling to swallow before blurting out, “Just what in the world is it?!”

It was a natural reaction. After all, he had traveled with his father across multiple villages, towns and cities across Heaventia, from Caput Town in the North, Brachi City in the East and Pes Village in the South. As an adamant food-try-it-all, he was certain he had experienced every flavor within a 4,000km reach. And yet…!

Vita giggled, a sound as bright as the morning itself. “Hehehe! ‘Course not. You see, I have access to some very ‘special’ ingredients!”

“S-special ingredients?... Ah! You mean… could it be?!”

Gaukel had finally pieced it together. This unfamiliar flavor could only mean one thing—it wasn't something that had simply slipped past him during his travels. No, this was made with ingredients foreign to Heaventia. And that could only mean one thing: they must have come from the Human Territory in the West.

“The dish here is known as «rasochi» and is traditional to the capital city Novus located in the Human Territory. It is a dessert made from the pulp of «sewa» fruits harvested from the «sawalsen» tree, mixed with «cannya» leaves and sweetened with «mel» syrup, which itself is derived from the sap of the «mepulsen» tree. It is elegantly garnished with seeds of «puchki» flower on top.” Vita explained, the words a tongue twister in Gaukel’s mind.

Although Vita made it sound easy, acquiring these ingredients had not been an easy task. There are only selected people allowed to cross between the two territories, resulting in the general population being ignorant regarding anything foreign. In fact, she had only learnt the existence of the dish the week before, and had memorized the ingredients only to show off. Having received only vague instructions as to how it was prepared, it is possible the real deal may be entirely different than how she ended up preparing it. Still, for a special occasion like today, she had wanted to surprise her friends in a unique way.

Vita had heard whispers about ongoing negotiations between the Angel and Human territories. Rumor had it that Balint, the head of the Heaventian Defense Forces and founder of the Angel-Human Alliance Council, was working on establishing trade between the two lands. And so, for weeks, she had persistently begged Balint to bring her the required ingredients from the Human Territory. Him being able to grant her wish was a sign that negotiations were progressing well.

“Gaukel, it seems that in no time, the world as we know it may change.”

The realization hit him: this was no longer about food—it was about bridging worlds, connecting cultures that had long been separate.

“Vita, do you believe it to be possible for the two sides to accept one another?” Gaukel asked.

“I need to believe in it,” she replied, her eyes reflecting a vision of a future where things such as divisions did not exist. No matter what, she desperately yearned for it. “Still, even if the day comes when we can move past our differences, it won’t matter until the great wall that separates us is destroyed.”

Before Gaukel could reply, their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of two more figures. “I wondeeeerrrr… what you guys have been talking abouuut!!” one of the newcomers called out with a playful grin.

“Ah! Lina! And Hya too! You guys are late!” Gaukel greeted them with a smile that quickly turned to concern as he noticed from the look of their eyes they had been crying. “And what’s with those eyes?!” he asked with concern.

“Can’t you tell, Gaukel? It’s painfully obvious our pair here couldn’t handle the pressure of today’s big event!! Of course they bawled their eyes out! Hahaha!” Vita chimed in casually, though she and Gaukel both knew there was more to it than that. Still, they played along, sensing that whatever had happened, Lina and Hya had already talked it over.

It had been four months since Vita and Gaukel last saw Hya outside the main building, and neither dared to mention it. They only wanted for him to enjoy the moment. Vita, in particular, knew Hya was struggling. To help, she had given him dried ravanki flower buds, known for their calming effects when brewed into tea.

“Anyway, Hya, Lina! I’ve been trying a new recipe. Care to try? I cooked enough for all four of us!! Hehehe!” Vita offered, hoping to lighten the mood.

Both Hya and Lina hesitated for a moment, then took a bite. Their eyes widened in surprise. “V-vita! Just what in the world is this!!” they exclaimed in unison, marveling at the unfamiliar flavors.

“This is raso—” Gaukel started to explain, but Vita quickly interrupted him, waving her hands theatrically. “Oioioioi, Gaukel! It’s a secret! They shall never know! Teehee!” she teased, her eyes twinkling with mischief.

The twins exchanged puzzled glances but didn’t press further. And so, the four friends laughed, continuing to enjoy their meal.

The four of them desperately ran towards the outside of the castle. Time had slipped through their fingers during their feast, and now, with hearts pounding and breath ragged, they realized they were on the verge of missing the event they had spent years preparing for.

“Waaaaittt for usss…!!” they screamed in unison.

Ahead, one carriage came into view, their doors open and ready to take them to a destination steeped in legend—the «Ruins of Birth». It was a sacred, ancient place, believed to be the cradle of the first angel's existence. There, the long-awaited «Awakening» ceremony would unfold.

Every four months, angels who have reached the age of sixteen are given the choice to undergo the Awakening. This sacred ceremony is not one to be taken lightly, for it demands more than just strength or courage—it requires the willingness to face one’s true self. During it, one is forced to confront the very core of their being, revealing not only their resolve but also their deepest vulnerabilities and flaws.

Those who are awakened are granted the ability to freely manifest their «aura». This unique and powerful energy is the mark of their awakening. Aura serves as both a shield and a weapon, a reflection of their true nature, and a sign that they have embraced every part of themselves.

Historically, an awakening served as a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood, but today, only a small percentage of the population chooses to undergo it for this reason alone. In modern times, only those who wish to join the Defense Forces undergo the ceremony, as aura is essential for combat.

The decline in the number of those willing to undergo the awakening is not without significant reasons. Those who try but are unable to awaken face a devastating consequence—a phenomenon known as an «overflow». When an angel’s aura manifests out of control, driven by overwhelming emotions, it spirals into chaos. The raw, unchecked power can consume them entirely, leading to madness or death. The possibility looms over every candidate.

Even then, after one is awakened, the possibility of an overflow lingers, as aura is mirrors the user’s mental state and shifts in response to their emotions. Angels have known this since ancient times, it is the reason pulsus moderatio came to be.

Lastly, each manifestation of aura gradually shortens the individual's lifespan. Thus, awakened angels face the harsh reality of a reduced lifespan compared to their unawakened counterparts, leading many to reconsider the decision to partake in the ceremony.

As they reached the carriage, only a single man waited there for them.

“Seriously, I was starting to think you all wouldn’t come…!” Balint sighted and started closing off the distance between them with a serious sight.

This is bad…!

The four of them braced themselves for a scolding, but instead, gentle pats landed on their heads. It was just like Balint—always kind and affectionate. Yet on a day like today, arriving late surely warranted some kind of lecture or a playful tug on their ears, so they were taken aback that none of that happened.

“The others have left already. We can still catch up to them.” Balint continued. “More importantly, …” he stopped, turning his gaze to Hya. “... Have you made up your mind, Hya?”

Lina, Vita and Gaukel had no clue as to what Balint was referring to. They too, turned their view to Hya as if in search of an answer, which embarrassed him a little.

And so, Hya, who had never asked for anything before, broke the silence. “I beg of you! Please, let me go through the awakening!” he said, bowing down so as to show respect.

"Hya... you...!" Vita exclaimed, and as the realization dawned on her, tears welled up in her eyes. Gaukel and Lina were equally stunned, their expressions mirroring her emotion. Hya wasn’t just seeing them off—he was joining them, heading to the ruins and planning to undergo the awakening with them...!

This was no simple request. It meant that once more, Hya would break the rules of the world. But Hya’s heart was set—he believed that by awakening, exposing his true self, demonstrating his resolve and offering up his lifespan to protect others, there was a chance. Perhaps only then would he earn the right to live freely. Perhaps only then could the world, in time, accept him. And if that happened, maybe—just maybe—tragedy would no longer fall upon those he loved.

Balint pulled him into a tender embrace. “You don’t need to beg for anything, idiot. I was hoping you would come. I will take care of everything. I will take responsibility for everything…!” he said, but before he could muster any further words, he broke down in tears.

Hya took a few seconds to answer back on Balint’s hug. Up to now, he had lived a life of surrendering his affection for others. But as if affirming to himself it didn’t need to be that way anymore, he wrapped his arms on him. “Thank you, … uncle.”

He had never called him that way before.

Hya looked back to his friends and smiled softly. They immediately joined in the embrace, which made it too tight and hard to breathe. But he did not complain one bit.

For those I love, I will rewrite even the rules of this world.

And so, for the second time in his life, Hya stepped beyond the walls of Anima Castle, and in that instant, it felt as though a cage had broken apart, liberating a beast to soar freely into the sky…
