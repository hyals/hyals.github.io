# CHAPTER 1 『Prologue of Death and Sorrow』

I’m sorry for letting each one of you die.

I’m powerless. All I can do is stand still, shuddering in fear, as I watch the human realm fall to its certain demise.

As the earth continues to crack, shatter and split open, countless pairs of hands emerge from within the crevices and soon after, drag humans to the abyss as they weep. Simultaneously, countless rays of light descend from the firmament.

In this moment, I can hear the screams of humans decaying right before me, while the bereavement echoed by their loved ones gets burnt into my mind. 

The whole world grows weak as time goes on. Disaster erodes all that once thrived, leaving only death in its wake. My head fills up with despair, increasing the feelings of regret I hold within.

As I stand amidst the ruins, I'm reminded of my cowardice. Fearful of losing those dear to me, I did nothing to protect them. Mired in the past, I lacked the courage to face tomorrow. Bound by my own chains, I hurt those around me.

Humans are such fragile beings. Like me, they are unable to do anything. But unlike me, they desperately cling on to hope, even if it’s no use.

I get it now. My inaction has always been my curse. No more. I vow to protect the world you fought for. Even if you are here no longer.

With a resolute wave of my hand, the gate before me swings open.
